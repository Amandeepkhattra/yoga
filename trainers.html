    <p>What is yoga, exactly? Is it just an exercise form? Is it a religion, a philosophy, an ideology? Or is it something else entirely? The word “yoga” literally means “union”. In these articles, Sadhguru explains that yoga essentially means “that which brings you to reality.”</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-2">
    <p>The spiritual path can be a confusing journey, and whether one is going forwards, backwards, or totally off-track may not be obvious at all. Sadhguru explains that spirituality essentially means breaking everything that limits us.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tabs-3">
    <p>Through these articles, Sadhguru explains that meditation is not an act; it is a quality that naturally manifests if we cultivate the right kind of inner situation. He also elaborates on the reason why most people who have tried meditation have come to the conclusion that it’s very difficult! </p>

 <div id="tabs-4">
    <p>Sadhguru explains how a person can be truly healthy in every aspect of life, not just free from disease: “The word health comes from the word whole. When your body, your mind, your emotion, your energies are in tune with each other and you feel wholesome within yourself, that is when you feel healthy."</p>
    
    </div> 
    <div id="tabs-5">
    <p>The mind is a fantastic instrument, but most human beings unfortunately suffer rather than benefit from its capabilities. Sadhguru looks at how yoga is a means to transcend the mind.</p>
